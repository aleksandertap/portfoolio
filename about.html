            <p>
              Hello! My name is Aleksander Täpsi, and I am a first-year student in Software Development at Tartu Vocational College. At 30 years old, my journey into the world of technology has been anything but conventional, but every step has shaped my passion for innovation and problem-solving. 
              <br><br>

              My fascination with science began during my secondary school years, where I developed a keen interest in understanding how things work. After graduating in 2013, I pursued studies in Mechatronics at Tallinn Technical University Tartu College. However, I soon realized that programming courses posed challenges I wasn't ready to tackle at the time, leading me to take a different path. Following this, I completed mandatory military service, which taught me resilience and discipline.
              <br><br>
              In 2015, I ventured into the mobile device industry, a field that perfectly combined recycling and technology. For nearly a decade, I thrived in this eco-friendly sector, embracing its challenges and opportunities. Yet, as time passed, I felt the pull to explore new horizons—to build, innovate, and create in ways I hadn't before. This curiosity led me to rediscover the IT world, sparking a new chapter in my life.
              <br><br>
              Returning to school after a decade was no small decision, but my excitement for Software Development made it an easy choice. This field captivates me because it offers the power to create tools, applications, and solutions that can have a tangible impact on businesses and individuals. I am eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry.
              <br><br>
              Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading books, diving into immersive stories, and playing strategic board games. I’m also deeply interested in the universe of Warhammer, which fuels my creativity and strategic thinking.
              <br><br>
              As a budding software developer, I am motivated to turn ideas into reality and embrace the challenges that come with this exciting career path. Thank you for visiting my e-portfolio, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you!
